\usage{
\method{predict}{dfm}(x, h = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of \code{dfm} class}

\item{h}{Forecasting horizon}
}
\value{
Returns prediction matrices for factors and input variables
based on model estimation. Each row corresponds to a prediction
horizon. First row is \code{T+1}, second -\code{T+2} and so on...
